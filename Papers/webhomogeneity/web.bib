abstract = { Visual design provides the backdrop to most of our interactions over the Internet,
but has not received as much analytical attention as textual content. Combining computational
with qualitative approaches, we investigate the growing concern that visual design
of the World Wide Web has homogenized over the past decade. By applying computer vision
techniques to a large dataset of representative websites images from 2003â€“2019, we
show that designs have become significantly more similar since 2007, especially for
page layouts where the average distance between sites decreased by over 30%. Synthesizing
interviews from 11 experienced web design professionals with our computational analyses,
we discuss causes of this homogenization including overlap in source code and libraries,
color scheme standardization, and support for mobile devices. Our results seek to
motivate future discussion of the factors that influence designers and their implications
on the future trajectory of web design.},
